At one point in development, we all need an error reporting tool. Sentry is an amazing Error Reporting/Tracking tool. I am a Django developer. In this blog I will show you how you can configure sentry with Django.

As it is pretty advanced thing, I assume you can setup django project and have basic knowledge about django. So, first of all, we need to install Raven.

```
pip install raven --upgrade
```
